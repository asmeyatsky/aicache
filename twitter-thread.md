Stop paying for duplicate AI queries! 🚀

Just launched AI Cache - intelligent CLI caching that saves 30-70% on AI costs.

One-minute setup:
```bash
pip install aicache[basic]
aicache init
```

Then use your AI tools normally and watch savings grow! 📊💰

The magic? Global cache architecture.

Same query in Project A = instant hit in Project B, C, D, E...

Cross-project compounding savings = 🤯

Real example:
```bash
~/api$ claude "debug JWT auth?"
~/frontend$ claude "debug JWT auth?"  ← INSTANT CACHE HIT!
~/mobile$ claude "debug JWT auth?"  ← INSTANT CACHE HIT!
```
