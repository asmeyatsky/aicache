# aicache: The Sentient Development Assistant

## Vision

Transform `aicache` from a powerful caching solution into a **sentient development assistant** that proactively helps developers write better code faster. `aicache` will not just be a cache; it will be a personalized, collaborative, and intelligent layer that sits between the developer and their tools, anticipating their needs and augmenting their capabilities.

## Key Pillars

1.  **Predictive & Proactive Caching:** Go beyond reactive caching. `aicache` will predict the developer's needs and pre-cache relevant information, learning from their behavior and project context to anticipate future actions.
2.  **AI-Powered Code Generation & Understanding:** `aicache` will not just store and retrieve data; it will *understand* it. It will use local and remote LLMs to generate code, explain complex concepts, and identify potential bugs before they are written.
3.  **Federated Learning & Collaborative Intelligence:** `aicache` will leverage the collective intelligence of the developer community without compromising privacy. It will use federated learning to train a global model that provides personalized recommendations and insights to all users.
4.  **Seamless IDE & Workflow Integration:** `aicache` will be deeply integrated into the developer's workflow, with a VS Code extension, a JetBrains plugin, and a GitHub App to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
